User Log Dashboard allows for uploading log files which can then display the data in a graph format for every user. The data can then be exported in either .xml or .csv data types.

How to use:
Run the logApp.exe file. From there you should be greeted with a blank dashboard with available Upload buttons in the top left. Upload the appropriate log txt file and the appropriate user data should be loaded in. The secondary button next to the main upload button will allow you to upload multiple log files at the same time to stack information on top of each other.

NOTICE: Valid JRE needs to be present in order for the executible to launch. A folder title "jre" is needed in the same directory as the .exe file. I had the best results using Zulu-8-jre (Version: Zulu8.76.0.18-SA-win64 Java Version: 1.8.0_402)
